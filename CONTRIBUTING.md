3. **Feedback** - You may receive feedback and requested changes
4. **Approval** - Once approved, your PR will be merged

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### General Principles

- **Readability** - Write code that's easy to read and understand
- **Consistency** - Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- **Simplicity** - Keep things simple and avoid over-engineering
- **Documentation** - Comment complex logic and public APIs

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper types for all variables and functions
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Avoid `any` type when possible

```typescript
// Good
interface User {
  id: string
  name: string
  email: string
}

const getUser = (id: string): Promise<User> => {
  // implementation
}

// Avoid
const getUser = (id: any): any => {
  // implementation
}
```

### Vue.js

- Use Composition API for new components
- Use `<script setup>` syntax when possible
- Follow Vue.js naming conventions
- Use proper prop validation

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
interface Props {
  title: string
  count?: number
}

const props = withDefaults(defineProps<Props>(), {
  count: 0
})

const emit = defineEmits<{
  update: [value: string]
}>()
</script>
```

### CSS/Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow utility-first approach
- Use CSS custom properties for theming
- Ensure responsive design

```vue
<template>
  <div class="flex items-center justify-between p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm">
    <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">{{ title }}</h2>
    <button class="px-4 py-2 text-sm font-medium text-white bg-blue-600 rounded-md hover:bg-blue-700">
      Action
    </button>
  </div>
</template>
```

## üí¨ Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.
